# Surveillance-and-Motion-Sensor-Alert-System-Notifying-Users-through-Motion-Detection

Aim

The aim of this project is to design and implement a simulated surveillance system integrated with motion detection sensors to monitor an environment and promptly notify the user whenever motion is detected. The system will be developed and demonstrated using Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate IoT-based security infrastructure.

Problem Statement

With increasing security concerns in both residential and industrial areas, there is a growing need for reliable surveillance systems capable of detecting unauthorized motion and immediately notifying users. Traditional surveillance setups often lack real-time alerts, requiring constant monitoring. Hence, there is a need for an IoT-based solution that automatically senses movement and triggers notifications without human intervention.

Scope of the Solution

The system is implemented within Cisco Packet Tracer, simulating an IoT-enabled surveillance infrastructure.

It demonstrates how motion sensors and cameras can be integrated into a network to detect activity and notify users in real-time.
